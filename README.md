# Using Machine Learning to Predict U.S. Opioid Long-Term Therapy Patients (Humana Mays Healthcare Competition 2019)
During the past few years, there has been a dramatic increase in prescription opioid use disorder (OUD), opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Moreover, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research, one out of four patients who receive long-term opioid therapy in primary care settings struggle with opioid use disorder. A model that is able to extract the knowledge of clinical characteristics associated with the progression of long-term opioid therapy can aid in the identification of disorder at-risk patients to provide the basis for developing targeted clinical interventions. Identifying potential abusers and preventing the outcome is of course far more cost-efficient, both in terms of finance and on the personâ€™s health, than attempting to intervene after abuse has been diagnosed.

This code aims to do just that: to identify memeber at risk or conitnued long-term use of opioid therapies to allow for early intervention. To do this, we use provided data containing information of 14k patients (pharmacy claims, surgeries, diagnosis, etc) to create a model to predict if a patient will continue opioid therapy six months after initital prescribing. 

This code was developed as part of our application to the Humana Mays Healthcare competition (2019). For more information you can visit: https://www.humanatamuanalytics.com/
